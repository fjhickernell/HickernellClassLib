# Confidence Intervals

If 

- $\theta$ is a parameter of interest of a distribution, and 

- $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are data that we assume are collected that follow that distribution, 

Then we will try to construct $\Theta_L$ and/or $\Theta_U$ depending on that data (and not on $\theta$) to give us intervals that [capture]{.alert} $\theta$ with high probability $1 - \alpha$

- $\Prob(\Theta_L \le \theta  \Theta_U) = 1 - \alpha$, or

- $\Prob(\Theta_L \le \theta) = 1 - \alpha$, or

- $\Prob(\theta \le \Theta_U) = 1 - \alpha$

Here $\alpha$ is our willingness to be wrong, typically $\alpha = 5\%$
